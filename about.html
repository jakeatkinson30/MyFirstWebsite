                During my time as a junior software developer with Appnovation, I was involved in the
                development and management of an e-commerce React application. Additionally, I worked with
                Redux for state management as well as Javascript, CSS and HTML. I am confident that I can
                quickly adapt to new technologies and trends and can be a valuable asset to your team. I have completed
                a full stack engineer course with IT Career Switch, which has given me a wide range of skills and
                knowledge with in a variety of tech languages.
                <br><br>
                Through my career, I have also had many experiences in the hospitality and health and fitness
                industry, specifically as a restaurant manager, nutritionist, and exercise referral specialist. These
                experiences have led me to growing skills that will help me develop and thrive in this role. I am
                looking to take the next step in my career through gaining experience, fine tuning my skills and
                advancing my knowledge in software development.
