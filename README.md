A page developed to showcase projects I am working on and provide contact details. 

Thank you for viewing my page. The aim of this project was initially to showcase my HTML/CSS skills and has additionally provided me the opportunity to provide links to projects I have been working on or have worked on. This page was initially designed to be viewed with a large viewports and via desktop computers. Therefore, the transition functionality of the project images will not work with mobile devices - I will remove this functionality for handheld or touchscreen devices. 

I have recently began adding Media Queries to the page, however these are not finalised and I am aware of bugs with the contact and project page.
