        <h1>About me.</h1>
        <p id="aboutPara">
            Throughout my career, I`ve had many experiences in the hospitality and health and fitness
            industry, specifically as a restaurant manager, nutritionist, and exercise referral specialist. These
            experiences have led me develop skills that will help me to grow and thrive in a new career path. I`m
            looking to take the next step in my career through gaining experience, fine tuning my skills and
            advancing my knowledge in software development.
            <br><br>
            A love for learning, a growth mindset and a dedicated learner means I not only wish to
            improve my knowledge in specific subjects, but to learn more about myself in order to
            aid my improvement in soft skills and leadership traits.
